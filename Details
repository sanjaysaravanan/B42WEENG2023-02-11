  Events: very very important concpet in web development

    1. Working with some more events

      onChange, onSubmit, onKeyDown, onScroll

Event Propagation:
  Example Task:
      table creation
    Creating a starter template from Bootstrap:

  id, class, nested structure, keys to pass test case 

  Discussion for Task
    Pagination
    calculator

  2. Concepts in events

    1. Propagation --> events propagate through inner <-> outer between related elements

      1. Bubbling (inner to outer) ---> event propagation of events from innerMost child to outermost parent 
      2. Capturing (outer to inner) ---> event progation of events from outermost parent to innermost child

      stopProgation func for an event
  removeEventListener -- events can only be removed wth name function
